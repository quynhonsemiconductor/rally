/**
 * Same-origin reverse proxy used by the Cloudflare Pages Function that fronts
 * the rally SPA. It forwards `/v1/*` (which includes the BFF auth routes
 * `/v1/bff/*`) from the SPA origin (`rally-dev.qnsc.vn`) to the API origin
 * (`rally-api-dev.qnsc.vn`), so the browser sees a single origin. That is what
 * lets the BFF issue a `__Host-rova_session` cookie with `SameSite=Strict` and
 * drop CORS entirely.
 *
 * The logic here is pure and framework-agnostic (only web-standard `Request` /
 * `Response` / `Headers` / `URL`), so it is unit-testable under the web app's
 * vitest and portable to a standalone Worker if we ever move off Pages.
 *
 * Requires the Pages project to expose `API_ORIGIN`, e.g.
 * `https://rally-api-dev.qnsc.vn`. The SPA always talks to the API through this
 * same-origin proxy (the BFF flow depends on it).
